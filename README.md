# Thank you for checking out my game!

## Try it out here:

## About the process:
This was made as part of a class to practice using front end JavaScript, HTML, and Sass.

In order to develop this game, I broke it down into bits. Those bits then became smaller bits. Any time I ran into something unexpected I would troubleshoot to try to see where the communication between the client and server was working (or not). I had family and friends help test the game and give feedback to ensure it worked as intended.

## To-Dos
Ideally, there are a few design items that can be polished and user game history could be more interactive than my current funcationality permits. Also, multi-player options would be an interesting exercise.

## Wireframes
My initial design was:

## User-stories
My first breakdown of what this game needed to work included:
* A user should be able to
  * sign up
  * log in
  * change password
  * start a new game as player x
  * join a game as player o
* A board that visually displays the state of the game and whether or not it is that player's turn
* If it is their turn the board should display available tiles and them to move into any of those
* The board should display the results of the game immediately after the winning tile is played
* The game over notice should allow either player to initiate a new game with the same opponent
